Reflection means how we are looking at our reflection in the mirror, reflection means looking at yourself or your actions
for example
- After giving a presentation, thinking about how it went
- After writing an email, reading it again to check if it's clear
- After making a decision, considiring if it was the right choise


So a reflection agent pattern is an AI system pattern that can look at its own 
outputs and think about them/make it better- just like how we look at
ourselves in a mirror and self-reflect, make ourselves better


Three types of reflection agents:
- 1.Basic Reflection Agent
- 2.Reflexion Agents
- 3.Language Agent tree seach
